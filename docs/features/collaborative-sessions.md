# Collaborative Sessions

## Overview

The Collaborative Sessions feature allows users to share their AI interactions with others in real-time. This enables collaborative problem-solving, knowledge sharing, and public demonstrations of AI capabilities. Users can invite specific collaborators to join their session or make their session public for anyone to view.

## Problem Statement

Current AI assistants are primarily designed for individual use, which limits:
- Collaborative problem-solving with colleagues
- Knowledge sharing and learning from others' AI interactions
- Live demonstrations for educational purposes
- Building community around AI use cases

## Solution

The Collaborative Sessions feature provides:
- Session sharing with specific users via invitation
- Public streaming of sessions for wider audiences
- Real-time updates of all interactions
- Role-based permissions (viewer, collaborator, owner)
- Presence indicators showing who is currently active
- Chat functionality for session participants

## Features

### 1. Session Sharing

Methods for sharing AI sessions:
- Direct invitations via email or username
- Shareable links with optional password protection
- Public/private visibility settings
- Temporary or permanent access options
- Integration with existing team/organization structures

### 2. Real-time Collaboration

Collaborative features during shared sessions:
- Multiple users can interact with the same AI assistant
- Live updates of all messages and responses
- Presence indicators showing who is typing
- Cursor tracking to see where others are focusing
- Conversation branching to explore alternative approaches

### 3. Role-Based Permissions

Different access levels for session participants:
- **Owner**: Full control over the session, including permissions
- **Collaborator**: Can interact with the AI and add content
- **Viewer**: Can only observe the session without contributing
- **Moderator**: Can manage participants but not own the session

### 4. Public Streaming

Features for public sessions:
- Public gallery of ongoing streams
- Categorization and tagging of public sessions
- Follower notifications when a user starts streaming
- View counters and engagement metrics
- Recording and playback of past sessions

### 5. Communication Tools

Tools for participants to communicate:
- Side chat for discussions without involving the AI
- Reaction emojis for quick feedback
- Annotation of AI responses
- Highlighting and commenting on specific parts of the conversation
- Voice and video options for richer collaboration

## User Experience

### Workflow Examples

#### Private Collaboration

1. User starts a conversation with the AI
2. User clicks "Share Session" and selects specific colleagues to invite
3. System sends invitations via email or in-app notifications
4. Colleagues join the session and see the full conversation history
5. All participants can interact with the AI, with indicators showing who is typing
6. Side chat allows participants to discuss without involving the AI
7. Owner can adjust permissions or end the shared session at any time

#### Public Streaming

1. User configures their session for public streaming
2. User adds title, description, and tags for discovery
3. Session appears in the public directory for others to find
4. Viewers can join the stream and watch the interaction in real-time
5. View counter shows how many people are watching
6. Viewers can react or comment in a moderated chat
7. User can save the session recording for future reference

#### Educational Demonstration

1. Teacher creates a session and shares a link with students
2. Students join as viewers initially
3. Teacher demonstrates AI interactions while explaining concepts
4. Teacher can promote select students to collaborators for hands-on practice
5. Session recording is saved for students who missed the live demonstration
6. Students can reference the session later when working on assignments
