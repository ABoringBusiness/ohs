# AI Agent Marketplace

## Overview

The AI Agent Marketplace is a platform where users can discover, share, and install specialized AI agents created by the community or professional developers. This feature transforms OpenHands from a single-agent platform into an ecosystem of specialized AI assistants, each designed for specific tasks or domains.
